    "We have a csv file with two columns: longitude and latitude. Each coordinate pair is the center of a volcano around the world. There are 1,509 volcanoes in our dataset. The original coordinate reference system is geographic coordinates with datum WGS84. We want to make a coordinate transformation of these data points to World Mercator. It will take much too long to manually transform these coordinates as we have done in the notebooks before. Therefore, our new code will read the csv file and create a new csv file.\n",

In this example, the volcanoes file (volc_longlat.csv) is in the directory ch2-5 in the user's Desktop.
